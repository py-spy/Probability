It is a mathematical calculation of chance of occurance of an event E.
It can be denoted as P(E)
Also, it lies in the interval [0,1]

Impossible Event: Will have probability zero, E can never occur

Sure Event: Will have probability as 1. E will def. occur

Sample Point: A possible outcome of an experiment is called sample point.

Sample Space: Set containig al possible outcomes. or it is a collection
of all sample points.

Random Experiment: Experiment for which all possible outcomes are known
but the obtained outcome of a particular trial is not known in advance.

Event: Subset of sample space.

Simple Event: Event having one sample
Coumpound Event: Event having more than one sample point

Equi Likely or Equi probable: Two outcomes are called equi-likely if
occurence of one is not favored over other.

Set of exhaustive events: If all possile outcomes are covered by a set of events
then this set is called set of exhasutive events.

Disjoint event or Incompatible events or mutually exclusive: If occurance of
one event rules out chance of occurance of other.

Independent Events: Two events are indpendent if occurance or non
occurance of one does not affect the chance of occurance of other.

Classical Definition of Probability
Let a sample contain m+n equally likely outcomes out of which m favors 
occuracne of an event E, then prob of occurance of E is P(E) = m/(m+n)
Number of fav outcomes / total number of outcomes.

*To apply this formula all outcomes should be equi likely
*In above case, odds in favor of E are m:n (fav:unfav)
* Odds against event E are n:m (unfav:fav)
